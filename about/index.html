            <h2>About Me</h2>
            </br>
            <p>I'm Ryan, a technologist whose curiosity was sparked at the age of eight by the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Bald_Hills_radiator" target="_blank">communications tower</a> in my home suburb of Bald Hills, Queensland.</p>
            <p>By 1995, my passion had evolved into creation. I was building websites using <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/" target="_blank">HTML 2.0</a> and scripting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC" target="_blank">mIRC</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_bot" target="_blank">bots</a> on <a href="https://www.austnet.org/" target="_blank">AusNet</a>—a foundation that led to a career at the intersection of technology and impactful innovation.</p>
            <p>Decades later, my experiences have expanded from coding to significant professional achievements in technology. Currently, I work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" target="_blank">advanced radar systems</a> that integrate with machine learning and neural networks, redefining how we interact with and benefit from artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>On my blog, I delve into myriad subjects—from the intricate nuances of 5G technology and AI to the very personal stories behind our advancements in aged care. I aspire to demystify the complexities of my work, making it both accessible and enlightening for my readers.</p>
