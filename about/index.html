            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ryan, a technologist with roots reaching back to 1990 in the youthful innocence of Bald Hills, Queensland. There, at the tender age of 8, my fascination with the digital world was ignited by the sight of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills_Radiator" target="_new">Bald Hill Radiator</a>, a towering symbol of connectivity that sparked a lifelong quest for innovation.</p>
            <p>By 1995, I was not just an enthusiastic kid with a zest for learning; I was a young web pioneer, constructing websites with HTML and scripting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC" target="_new">mIRC</a> bots on AustNet. These early ventures into coding and online communities provided the foundation for a career that merges technology with transformative impacts.</p>
            <p>Here we are now, decades later, and I've transitioned from playing with code as an 11-year-old to shaping the future of health tech as a professional. My current work involves developing cutting-edge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency">mmWave 5G radar</a> systems integrated with artificial intelligence. These systems are not just marvels of engineering; they are the compassionate ears listening to the silent language of the human body. Through meticulous analysis of subtle movements, we unveil crucial health insights that have the potential to revolutionise individual care and outcomes.</p>
            <p>On my blog, established in 2023, I delve into a myriad of subjectsâ€”from the intricate nuances of 5G technology and AI to the very personal stories behind our advancements in aged care. I aspire to demystify the complexities of our work, making it accessible and enlightening for my readership. </p>
