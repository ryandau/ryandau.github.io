            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>I'm Ryan, a technologist whose curiosity was sparked at age 8 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills_Radiator" target="_blank">communications tower</a> in my home suburb of Bald Hills, Queensland.</p>
            <p>By 1995, my passion had evolved into creation. I was building websites using HTML and scripting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC">mIRC</a> bots on AustNet, laying the groundwork for a career fusing technology with meaningful innovation.</p>
            <p>Decades later, I've progressed from youthful coding to redefining technology as a professional. My work now focuses on developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency"></a>mmWave 5G radar systems</a> integrated with AI. These systems aren't simply technical achievements; they're tools for understanding the "silent language" of the human body to improve care.</p>
            <p>On my blog, established in 2023, I delve into a myriad of subjectsâ€”from the intricate nuances of 5G technology and AI to the very personal stories behind our advancements in aged care. I aspire to demystify the complexities of our work, making it accessible and enlightening for my readership. </p>
